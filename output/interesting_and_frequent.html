while Senator <b>McCain</b> was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.<br /><br />When John <b>McCain</b> said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.<br /><br />John <b>McCain</b> likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.<br /><br />And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John <b>McCain</b> stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.<br /><br />If John

possible - they just don't think their leaders do.<br /><br />How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as <b>America</b> <br /><br />She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for <b>America</b> <br /><br />Never again can we expect the oceans that surround <b>America</b> to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.<br /><br />You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back <b>America</b> conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.<br /><br />That's what <b>America</b> is.<br /><br />Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent <b>America</b> <br /><br />A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across <b>America</b> <br /><br />And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when <b>America</b> renewed its purpose.<br /><br />They can say that this was the time when <b>America</b> found its way.<br /><br />They can say that this was the time when <b>America</b> learned to dream again.<br /><br />As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from <b>America</b> when I was still young.<br /><br />A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>America</b>  people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.<br /><br />And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on <b>America</b> <br /><br />As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about <b>America</b> s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.<br /><br />We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats <b>America</b> now faces ?<br /><br />And it is time to refocus <b>America</b> s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.</td></tr><tr><td>Continent (5)</td><td>doc4</td><td>0.0344571</td><td>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African <b>continent</b> as a whole.<br /><br />But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African <b>continent</b> have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.<br /><br />And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African <b>continent</b> is blessed - with great gifts and riches.<br /><br />A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great <b>continent</b> <br /><br />Like many nations across this <b>continent</b>  where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.</td></tr><tr><td>Kiev (3)</td><td>doc6</td><td>0.03217238</td><td>We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in <b>Kiev</b> <br /><br />While

working and what's not.</td></tr><tr><td>Thinking (3)</td><td>doc6</td><td>0.03217238</td><td>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start <b>thinking</b> creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.<br /><br />One way we could strengthen this relationship is by <b>thinking</b> about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.<br /><br />But <b>thinking</b> of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.</td></tr><tr><td>Phased (6)</td><td>doc5</td><td>0.0310284</td><td>When I came here and gave a speech on this

timetable that would begin in four to six months.<br /><br />When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this <b>phased</b> redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.<br /><br />For only through this <b>phased</b> redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?<br /><br />As a <b>phased</b> redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.<br /><br />The second part of our strategy should be to couple this <b>phased</b> redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?</td></tr><tr><td>Party (20)</td><td>doc3, doc1, doc2</td><td>0.03100212</td><td>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other <b>party</b>

aggression.<br /><br />I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear <b>weapons</b> out of terrorist hands.<br /><br />Of course, in the end, one of the strongest <b>weapons</b> your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.<br /><br />Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.<br /><br />I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.<br /><br />We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction.<br /><br />and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.<br /><br />And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear <b>weapons</b> terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.<br /><br />As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous <b>weapons</b>  as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.<br /><br />This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological <b>weapons</b> program.<br /><br />Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest <b>weapons</b> that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.<br /><br />But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these <b>weapons</b> has never been greater.<br /><br />And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.<br /><br />We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet <b>weapons</b> scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.<br /><br />We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet <b>weapons</b> scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.<br /><br />Some <b>weapons</b> experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.<br /><br />And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological <b>weapons</b> within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.<br /><br />Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear <b>weapons</b> - serves as a model of how we can do this.<br /><br />In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear <b>weapons</b> and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.<br /><br />I want to turn to a second critical area: biological <b>weapons</b> threat reduction programs.<br /><br />But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological <b>weapons</b> program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.<br /><br />My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical <b>weapons</b> <br /><br />On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional <b>weapons</b>  and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.<br /><br />In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional <b>weapons</b> that were slowly being dismantled.<br /><br />While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these <b>weapons</b> <br /><br />But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these <b>weapons</b> to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.<br /><br />But when we think about the threat that these <b>weapons</b> pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.<br /><br />We must safeguard these dangerous <b>weapons</b>  material, and expertise.</td></tr><tr><td>Know (52)</td><td>doc6, doc1, doc5, doc2, doc3, doc4</td><td>0.02707769</td><td>It's humbling, but in my heart I <b>know</b> you

has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <b>American</b> history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.<br /><br />Throughout <b>American</b> history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.<br /><br />In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the <b>American</b> people ?<br /><br />A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>American</b> people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.<br /><br />And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <b>American</b> people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.<br /><br />the <b>American</b> people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?<br /><br />Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <b>American</b> troops arrived.<br /><br />When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of <b>American</b> troops from Iraqi soil.<br /><br />300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <b>American</b> troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.<br /><br />The addition of 4,000 <b>American</b> troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.<br /><br />And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <b>American</b> soldiers.<br /><br />“rejected the notion of an <b>American</b> ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”<br /><br />“rejected the notion of an <b>American</b> ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift

Iraq.”<br /><br />And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of <b>American</b> resolve.<br /><br />The <b>American</b> people have been extraordinarily resolved.<br /><br />It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding <b>American</b> forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.<br /><br />The <b>American</b> soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.<br /><br />Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put <b>American</b> troops in danger.<br /><br />As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <b>American</b> enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.<br /><br />But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <b>American</b> history.<br /><br />and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <b>American</b> people.<br /><br />But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <b>American</b> University in 1963 about

the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived <b>war</b> can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.<br /><br />But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this <b>war</b> in Iraq.<br /><br />Most of you know I opposed this <b>war</b> from the start.<br /><br />It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil <b>war</b> <br /><br />Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this <b>war</b> - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.<br /><br />We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at <b>war</b>  our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.<br /><br />For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this <b>war</b>  knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.<br /><br />And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided <b>war</b> <br /><br />I will end this <b>war</b> in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Whether it's the <b>war</b> or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.<br

uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.<br /><br />In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by <b>war</b> and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.<br /><br />And when we do go to <b>war</b>  let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.<br /><br />But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of <b>war</b> or ethnic conflict.<br /><br />It can shield a <b>war</b> criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.<br /><br />Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to <b>war</b> in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.<br /><br />And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the <b>war</b> on terror as a political football are over.<br /><br />2,867 Americans have now died in this <b>war</b> <br /><br />And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the <b>war</b> in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.<br /><br />And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the <b>war</b> in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.<br /><br />This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this <b>war</b>  and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.<br /><br />I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a <b>war</b> in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.<br /><br />Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this <b>war</b> s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.<br /><br />When I came here and gave a speech on this <b>war</b> a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.<br /><br />And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided <b>war</b> <br /><br />For the fact is that there are no good options left in this <b>war</b> <br /><br />And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this <b>war</b> is simply a matter of American resolve.<br /><br />And, while some have proposed escalating this <b>war</b> by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.<br /><br />Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil <b>war</b> <br /><br />But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this <b>war</b> <br /><br />This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider <b>war</b>  consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.<br /><br />The President’s decision to go to <b>war</b> in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.<br /><br />This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this <b>war</b> <br /><br />The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil <b>war</b>  and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.<br /><br />Many who supported the original decision to go to <b>war</b> in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.<br /><br />that the rationale behind the <b>war</b> itself was misguided.<br /><br />The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for <b>war</b>  you must also plan for success.<br /><br />The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the <b>war</b> is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.<br /><br />Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold <b>War</b> <br /><br />Throughout the Cold <b>War</b>  the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive
