# Introduction

## Basic information
Create an index of most interesting words from a collection of text files

## Code

Code can be found written inside three classes: 
- DocumentReader.py   [main]
- InterestingWords.py 
- WordProcessor.py


## Instructions to run: 
- Uncompress the zip file provided

- install requirements:   
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

- Run `DocumentReader.py` from command-line using the following: 
- Example usage: 
`python DocumentReader.py -i ./data/ -o ./output/interesting_and_frequent.html -s iaf`

        Inputs switches: 
        -i - Path to folder containing input text files, use ./data/  
        -o - [optional] Path to the html file output, use my_file.html  
        -s - [optional] The sorting order, see below

        Possible value sorting order can take are the following:  
        iaf - lists words by importance and frequency,  
        fai - lists words by frequency and importance,  
        by default words get listed by frequency only`

##  List of most frequent interesting words as HTML: 
The `./output` folder already contains HTMLs generated by the code.  Each HTML presents the words sorted in a different order:  
- `frequent_and_interesting.html`  - sorted as most frequent and then by their tf-idf score 
- `interesting_and_frequent.html`  - sorted by their tf-idf score and then as most frequent 
- `most_frequent.html`  - sorted in most to least frequent 

##  Sphinx Documentation 
The code is documented with docstrings.  
A Sphinx generated documentation can be found by browsing to:  `./documentation/index.html`
